# Open AI fine tuning copy and paste code
This is pretty much the same code as what Open AI shows on their documentation but as a complete code to copy and paste. All you have to do is insert your API KEY and mod the prompt.

Also there is a monitoring version of the code that basically updates you with the status of the fine tuning or any errors.
